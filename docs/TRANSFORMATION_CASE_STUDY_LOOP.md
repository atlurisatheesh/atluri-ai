# Transformation Case Study Loop

## Goal
Create a repeatable evidence engine: candidate baseline -> behavioral change -> measurable delta -> public proof.

## Weekly Loop
1. Identify candidates with meaningful delta (>= +5 pts)
2. Collect short narrative of what changed
3. Convert to standardized case-study card
4. Publish across website + LinkedIn + demo assets
5. Feed new objections back into onboarding and product hints

## Qualification Rules
- Session count >= 3
- Confidence band is `medium` or `high`
- Delta is sustained (not one-session spike only)

## Case Study Template
- Candidate context (role target)
- Baseline Offer Probability
- Latest Offer Probability
- Delta
- What changed (2 bullet points)
- Top negative driver before
- Fix applied
- Outcome signal (screening passed / final round / offer)

## Output Formats
- One visual card (before/after)
- One short post (150–250 words)
- One 30-second clip snippet from the 2-minute demo flow

## KPI Tracking
- Case studies published per week
- Engagement rate per case study
- Trial signup lift after publication
- Share snapshot usage lift
- Testimonial conversion rate

## Governance
- Require candidate consent for publication
- Redact any sensitive company/person identifiers
- Keep all claims tied to measurable app output
