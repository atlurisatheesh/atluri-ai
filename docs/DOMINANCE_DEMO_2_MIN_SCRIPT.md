# Dominance Demo (2-Minute Script)

## Objective
Show weak answer -> live perception reaction -> coached fix -> probability increase in one uninterrupted flow.

## Runtime
- Target length: 90–120 seconds
- Format: screen capture with minimal voiceover

## Scene 1 (0:00–0:20) — Weak Baseline
- Open app and click `Run First Pressure Round (1-Click)`
- Show a weak answer (vague, low metrics, loose STAR)
- Capture live panel state: lower credibility, higher risk drift

Voiceover cue:
- "This is how most prep tools stop: generic feedback after the fact."

## Scene 2 (0:20–0:55) — Live Reaction
- Keep typing while transcript tags appear (`Context`, `Action`, `Result`, `Reflection`)
- Highlight weak-span flags (`vague`, `unsupported`, `filler-heavy`)
- Show pressure/risk pulse behavior in-panel

Voiceover cue:
- "The system judges interviewer perception live, not post-hoc."

## Scene 3 (0:55–1:25) — Correction + Improvement
- Rewrite with measurable impact and tighter STAR structure
- Submit answer
- Show session-end delta card: what changed + what to fix next

Voiceover cue:
- "You see exactly what changed and why probability moved."

## Scene 4 (1:25–1:55) — Outcome Snapshot
- Open dashboard primary KPI
- Show Offer Probability value, delta, confidence band, negative drivers
- Click `Share Improvement Snapshot`

Voiceover cue:
- "This is not answer generation. This is offer-probability improvement."

## Closing (1:55–2:00)
- On-screen text:
  - "From interview practice -> offer probability engine"
  - "Run your first pressure round now"

## Production Checklist
- Ensure no personal data in recording
- Keep cursor movement intentional and fast
- Use one coherent candidate scenario
- Export versions for LinkedIn (vertical) and website (horizontal)
